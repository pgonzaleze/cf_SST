# cf_SST
Repository of coral bleaching based on cloud cover and SST 

The file "cloud_fraction_xarray" in working, the aim is to retrieve a single value from especific sites on especific date based on a .CSV file "CBdbV2". 

NOTE: NetCDF files for cloud_fraction are extremely heavy (7 GB), so I run this code in an external HD.
